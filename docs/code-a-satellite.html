            <h3>Discussion prompts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What parts of the world can you see on this satellite image and why do you think that?</li>
                <li>What causes the white areas that you can see on the satellite image? Why do you think you can see different patterns?</li>
                <li>Why are some parts of the land different colours? What could be some reasons for this?</li>
                <li>Why do you think a satellite image like this could be useful to us?</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>What is a satellite, and why do we care?</h3>
            <p>A satellite is an object in space, that orbits (travels around) another object, usually a planet such as Earth. </p>
            <p>There are many types of satellites, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation satellites, e.g. GPS</li>
                <li>Communication satellites, e.g. Sky TV</li>
                <li>Natural satellites, e.g. the Moon</li>
                <li>Space stations, e.g. the ISS</li>
                <li>Remote sensing satellites, e.g. the one used to take the image above</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remote sensing satellites are used to gather information about an object while orbiting around it. Around the Earth, they are used for a variety of purposes, including weather forecasts, land surveying and humanitarian applications.</p>
            <p><strong>In this workshop, you will use a BBC micro:bit to model a satellite, thinking about its power and its orbit, and how it communicates with people back on Earth.</strong></p>

            <p>In a new tab, go to the <a href="https://python.microbit.org/" target="_blank">Micro:bit Python Editor</a>.</p>
            <p>Before changing any code, get your micro:bit connected:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug the micro:bit into your computer</li>
                <li>Click the purple <strong>Send to micro:bit</strong> button on the bottom left</li>
                <li>Follow the onscreen instructions to pair your micro:bit</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Does your physical micro:bit scroll 'Hello' and show you a heart?</p>
            <p>If yes, well done! You can start changing the code - see below for some ideas.</p>
            <p>If no, try again, then see <a href="https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/transfer-code-to-the-microbit/#introduction" target="_blank">the micro:bit user guide</a> for some troubleshooting ideas.</p>
            <br>
            <pre>from microbit import *

while True:
    display.show(Image.HEART)
    sleep(1000)
    display.scroll()</pre>
            <br>
            <p>Try out the ideas below. It's a good idea to change one thing at a time - test your changes by clicking <strong>Send to micro:bit</strong> again.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Change the <code>HEART</code> image to something else - watch out for capital letters!</li>
                <li>Change <code>'Hello'</code> to some other text such as your name - be careful of the apostrophes!</li>
                <li>What happens if you change the number inside <code>sleep(1000)</code> to something else?</li>
                <li><code>while True</code> means forever - can you change the code so that the scrolling text only happens once at the start instead of repeating?</li>
                <li>Try adding sound effects! Can you find the correct syntax in the <strong>Reference</strong> menu?</li>
            </ol>

        <div id="radio" class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Radio Ground Control</h2>

                    <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\Satellites-Connected.gif" alt="Screenshot of Ground Control's printout. At the top is the heading 'micro:bit flashed' and a tickmark. Underneath is a scrolling screen showing different satellites connected, for example 'ISS connected', 'PyConUK connected', Satellite 5 connected'.">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>It is important that your satellite has a way of communicating with the scientists back on Earth.</p>
            <p>The micro:bit at the front is Ground Control - it is set up to receive the messages that you send and display them.</p>
            <p><em>To set this up for yourself at home, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Isioviel/PyConUK2025/refs/heads/main/examples/GroundControl.py" target="_blank">click here for the Ground Control code</a>.</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>To send your messages, you first need to set up the radio, then send your message.</p>
            <p>Add the new lines of code starting on line 3</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>After</strong> <code>: from microbit import *</code></li>
                <li><strong>Before</strong> <code>: while True</code></li>
            </ul>
            <pre>import radio
radio.on()
            </pre>
            <p>Now, pick a name for your satellite - use something short to leave space for error messages. <em>There is a limit of 29 characters, a longer string will be cut short and not displayed by Ground Control.</em></p>
            <p>Then on the next line, use this syntax to send Ground Control a message:</p>
            <pre>radio.send('PyConUK connected')</pre>
            <br>

            <p>Now that you have a way to communicate with Ground Control, you can start sending useful messages.</p>
            <p>In the next two sections, you will get data from the micro:bits sensors and check that they are as you expect. If they are not, you can let Ground Control know!</p>

            <p>The display of the micro:bit is also its light sensor. You will use this to check how much light the micro:bit can sense.</p>
            <p>Before you can send useful information to Ground Control, you need to work out what is a 'normal' light level for your satellite.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Inside your</strong><code> while True </code> loop, add this code:</p>
            <pre>    light = display.read_light_level()
    print(light)
            </pre>
            <p>Click the <strong>Show serial</strong> button on the bottom right - this will open the <strong>terminal</strong> like this:</p>
            <div class="pure-g">
                <div class="pure-u-1-1">
                    <img class="pure-img-responsive" src=".\images\Light-Levels.png" alt="Screenshot of the code described above. Underneath is the open terminal, showing some numbers: 108,109,105,105,108,108.">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>What are the light levels like in your area?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the table?</li>
                <li>When you are holding it?</li>
                <li>Under the table?</li>
                <li>When you shine a torch on it?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>If your program is running too slowly, delete some of the other code inside your while loop!</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>If your micro:bit's normal light levels, when sat on the table, are about 100, you can send a warning to Ground Control when it gets too low, using code like this:</p>
            <pre>    if light < 80:
        radio.send('PyConUK low power')</pre>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> At the moment, you don't care if there is <strong>too much</strong> light, you only care if the satellite is running out of power. Can you add further code to send a warning when the light levels are much higher than normal?</p>
        </div>

        <div id="acceleration" class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-yellow">Check Orbit</h2>

            <div class="pure-g">

            <p>Another important thing to warn Ground Control about, is if your satellite's orbit is not stable. We can check this by sensing the <strong>acceleration</strong>.</p>
            <p>When a satellite is orbiting the Earth, it is travelling at a <strong>constant velocity</strong>, meaning that the only acceleration it feels is that of gravity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If it starts to speed up, it will exit the atmosphere and fly off into space - useful for rockets.</li>
                <li>If it starts to slow down, it will get pulled back down to earth by gravity - useful when the satellite has reached the end of its life.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Using similar code to the light sensing, you can see what acceleration the micro:bit senses when it is not moving:</p>
            <p><strong>Inside your</strong><code> while True </code> loop, add this code:</p>
            <pre>    acc = accelerometer.get_strength()
    print(acc)
            </pre>
            <p>Click the <strong>Show serial</strong> button on the bottom right to see the data.</p>
            <p>What are the acceleration levels like?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On the table?</li>
                <li>When you pick it up?</li>
                <li>When you knock the table?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Can you work out how to send warning messages for an unstable orbit? <em>Look carefully at your light sensing code for a hint.</em></p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">What next?</h2>
            <p>You have made some great progress on your satellite model, well done!</p>
            <p>If you would like to keep going, there are some ideas below.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check for a stable orbit.</strong> If we did not have time to do this during the workshop, <a href="#acceleration">click here for the code example and instructions</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Add sound effects.</strong> Sound can't travel in space, but it can be useful for scientists and engineers during testing. Can you add a noise every time you send an error message?</li>
                <li><strong>Challenging</strong>: <a href="brightness.html" target="_blank">adjust the display brightness when low on power</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore other sensors.</strong> Look through the <strong>Reference</strong> menu to see some of the other sensors you could use - what do you think would be useful for a satellite?</li>
            </ul>
